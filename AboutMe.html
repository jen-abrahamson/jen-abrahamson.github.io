							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My enthusiasm for remote sensing began my freshman year of undergraduate when I was hired as a research assistant in a geomorphology research lab. For over 2.5 years, I conducted 
							research that focused on analyzing fluvial systems to assess changes in the landscape. I analyzed high-resolution digital elevation models generated from Lidar data using MatLab.  
							This included analyzing longitudinal profiles and producing chi-plots to investigate associations of different parameters within fluvial systems. I participated and led two weeks of 
							international fieldwork in Norway to collect in-situ ground samples for validation. This project gave me a foundation in understanding fluvial systems and taught me formal research skills 
							from three successfully funded grants to presenting my work at the GSAâ€™s Annual Meeting.
								
							I decided to broaden my foundations in all aspects of earth science and worked as a research assistant in an ecology research lab focused on nutrient retention and biogeochemical impacts 
							associated with stormwater runoff.  I developed an interest in numerical modeling and using complex statistical analyses to better understand earth processes. This experience rounded my 
							knowledge of fluvial systems by applying the environmental chemistry components that occur when water interacts with the landscape. My team and I competed with this research at the EPA P3 
							Sustainable Design Competition where we were successfully awarded the EPA P3 Grant. I also served as a co-author on a publication for this project in the journal Water.  

							After obtaining my B.S., I put my education into practice by working in environmental consulting for 2 years. To advance my ability to contribute to more complex data analysis projects, I 
							completed a Data Science certificate from Stanford University where I solidified my foundation in Python and R programming, as well as statistics.  This led to my desire to pursue a Ph.D. 
							that combined my data science skills with my passion for earth science.
